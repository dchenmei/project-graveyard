# Regexpert

A fun mystery game to help learn regular expressions. 


**Why?** In one of my CS class, a professor attempted to teach regular expression through PPT slides. Like most things in programming, PPTs help you know what it is but not how to use it. Hence this little game to make the process more engaging.
