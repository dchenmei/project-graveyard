A major robbery has taken place in the high security facility last night. A hundred kilograms of pure, organic, natural, locally sourced, cane sugar candy have been stolen. 

The offenders wore high tech invisible suits and were not caught on camera. There were no traces except one. One of them used their mobile device and sent a text while inside the facility. Our network experts were able to locate an ip address and extract information from the device.

Your task is to sift through all the information, which may or not be related to the offenders and find clues. 

In order to do so, we are going to equip you with the power of Regular Expressions or regex for sort. This training will familiarize you with the advanced technology and become a regexpert
